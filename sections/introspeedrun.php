            <h3>SPEEDRUN</h3>
            <p class="linked">In 1993, ID Software releases Doom which becomes an international success. One year after its release, a website by
                the name of LMP Hall of Fame lets players upload their gameplay clips in the hopes of obtaining “DOOM Honorifics
                Titles”, the goal being finishing the game with various challenges or as quick as possible. This is how speedrunning
                was born. In November of the same year the COMPET-N website was created and becomes the cornerstone of the DOOM speedruning
                community. </p>
