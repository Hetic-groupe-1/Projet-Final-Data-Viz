        <h2>In 1993, ID Software releases Doom which becomes an international success. One year after its release, a website by the name of LMP Hall of Fame 
            lets players upload their gameplay clips in the hopes of obtaining “DOOM Honorifics Titles”, the goal being finishing the game with various challenges or as quick as possible. This is 
            how speedrunning was born. In November of the same year the COMPET-N website was created and becomes the cornerstone of the DOOM speedruning community. </h2>
