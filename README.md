<h2>Project presentation</h2>

<p>Twitch is an entertainment platform that has dominated their share of the market, a market which they are almost solely responsibly for. Since 2014 they have been the reference for all streamers and video game enthuasiasts alike in terms of content creation, consumption and sharing. From its humble beginnings as a competitive speedrunning scene to its huge financial and cultural success, both for itself and its content creators, it has morphed into an amazing pathway to philanthropic behavior. What's more is that the root of Twitch's purpose, its "raison d'etre" was indeed sharing the exploit of speedrunning a video game which shares an intimate connection in its involvement to charity streaming events.</p>

<p>With our project, we attempt to demonstrate Twitch's effectiveness when used to promote non-profit organizations both with and without events, particularly with its younger demographic.</p>
